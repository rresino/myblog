Yes, I created a new blog to put some information about technology and software development.

I'm using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate it from markdown pages.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
